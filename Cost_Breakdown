1. Domain Registration and Management on Squarespace

    Current Situation: Domain is already hosted on Squarespace.
    Cost: Assuming you're on a plan that includes domain management, the domain registration cost might already be covered for the first year. Subsequent years could be around $20 per year for the domain renewal fee.

2. Use a Simple Website Builder with Squarespace

Squarespace offers its own website builder, and with careful planning, you can stay within budget by leveraging their Business Plan for some features while using third-party integrations for others.

    Squarespace Business Plan:
        Cost: $276 per year ($23/month).
        Includes: Basic e-commerce features, appointment scheduling through Acuity Scheduling integration (at an additional cost), and the ability to add custom code for added functionalities.

        If You Need More Features:
